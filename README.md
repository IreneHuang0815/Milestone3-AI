Look under Assets/Finished/Scenes/ for
Tutorial-done and CS4455_Demo 
 
Here is a video that goes with the tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx21y9eJq1U">Mecanim Tutorial Video</a>
 
There are some fixes for going from Unity4 to Unity5, which I have already applied to the project hosted here. Useful fixes discussed in the youtube comments in link above (seriously!).


## AI Resources

Additionally, this project includes CS4455_AI_Demo as well as associated scripts AINavSteeringController and AIDemoController

AINavSteeringController is a script that interfaces Unity's NavMesh with fully mecanim-controlled characters. More info is in "NavMeshAgent Instructions.pdf" in the root of this repo.

AIDemoController is an accompanying demonstration AI state machine (procedural style) that interfaces with AINavSteeringController.
